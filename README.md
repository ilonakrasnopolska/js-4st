I have completed a mini-project - a shopping cart,
/ Without using objects
/ Used arrays for practice
/ The code is built on functions, arrays, and loops
/ Used a render function to display the list
/ Created a product search, where only the card of the specific product remains when searching
/ Used a function to calculate the total cost in case of increasing the quantity of items, removing li cards, or reducing the quantity of items
/ Created a cart button with a counter that indicates the number of items in the cart.
